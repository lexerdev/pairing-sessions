# Pairing Sessions

At Lexer we know collaboration is crucial to build an amazing product. Pair programming isn't just a way to grow our skills but to achieve great outcomes for our customers.

We've developed these notebooks as starting points to work with customer data and explore common challenges we encounter. 

The exercises below will launch with [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) so we recommended that you [become familiar](https://youtu.be/inN8seMm7UI) with this interface, similar to a Jupyter notebook, before starting.

Once completing the excercise save a copy of your work in Google Drive so you can share it later.
