# Pairing Sessions

At Lexer, we promote collaboration across functions to build an amazing product and achieve outcomes for our customers. We believe pair programming is a way to achieve this and grow our skills.

We've developed these notebooks as starting points to work with customer data and explore common challenges we encounter. 

The exercises below will be launched with [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) so we recommended that you [become familiar](https://youtu.be/inN8seMm7UI) with this interface, similar to a Jupyter notebook, before starting.

Once completing the excercise save a copy of your work in Google Drive so you can share it later.
